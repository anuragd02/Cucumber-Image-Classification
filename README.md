# Cucumber Disease Classification

To classify cucumber leaves as either healthy or affected by powdery mildew disease using machine learning and deep learning models, facilitating early disease detection for better crop management.
This work includes implementing, training, and evaluating multiple models to identify the most suitable one for the application.

**Models Used**
1) Machine Learning:
    - Decision Tree
    - Random Forests
    - Support Vector Machines
    - k-Nearest Neighbors
    - Bagging Regression
    - XG Boost Regression
    - Logistic Regression
    - Deep Learning:

2) Neural Networks
    - CNN + Softmax
    - VGG16
    - Inception Network
    - Metrics for Evaluation

**Classification Metrics:**
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC, Confusion Matrix

**Regression Metrics:**
MAE, MSE, RMSE, Explained Variance Score, RÂ² Score, Mean Bias Deviation (MBD)

**Purpose:**
    - Early detection of powdery mildew for targeted treatment.
    - Improved resource management and reduced crop losses.
